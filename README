QUESTION 1 :
An interesting problem is to print out all the anagrams of a given word. That is, given an N-letter word with all letters 
different, print all the “words” you can form using each letter once, regardless of whether they are actual words in some language.
The number of such rearrangements is N-factorial where N is the number of letters. The problem can be solved in several different 
ways, one of which uses one queue and one stack.

QUESTION 2 :

- Create a binary tree
- Determine the equivalence of 2 binary trees
